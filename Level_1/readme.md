# PYTHON : 10 DAYS LEVEL-UP CHALLANGE [DAY-1]

## 1. Welcome To The Challange
Our first exercise starts with very basic concept of ask user for input his/her name and welcome that user with his/her name.

Additional thing we can do to avoid make this exercise so basic that we also greet user according to the time like night, day or noon.

so here we go...


**Steps :**

  - [Extract Current time of the day](#extract-current-time-of-the-day)
  - [User Input](#user-input)
  - [Set Greeting Quote](#set-greeting-quote)
  - [Output](#output)
         

### - Extract Current time of the day
For extracting exact time [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) module is used. Modules are basically block of codes which are written by someone else and we are use it in our code via importing them, like :

```python
import time
realTime = int(time.strftime('%H'))
```

* Here we import the [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) module and with the help of method `time.strftime('%H')` we get current hour and store it in variable after conevert it into a intiger via Type-casting [int( )](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int). 

### - User Input
In Python user input taken by [input( )](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input)

```python
user = input("Enter Your Name: ")
```

### - Set Greeting Quote
Now, greet text individually set accorfing to realTime. For that we use python [if..elif..else](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements) statement.

```python
if(realTime<12):
    print("Good Morning", user, end=". ")

elif(realTime<16):
    print("Good Afternoon", user, end=". ")

else:
    print("Good Night", user, end=". ")
```


> Note: In python `Indentation` used for indicating block or any function of loop instead of any { }

* Python [print( )](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) used to display and `end=" "` is parameter in the print function is used to add any string. At the end of the output of the print statement in python
  
* > By default, the print function ends with a newline `'\n'`.

At the end welcome statement will placed
```python
print("Welcome To The 10 Days Python Level-Up Challange.")
```

##  output :

###### END


> See You In Level 2 ðŸ‘€....
